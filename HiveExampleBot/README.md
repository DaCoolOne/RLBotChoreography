# Hivemind Example Bot

This is a custom Rocket League bot which uses one process to control multiple instances of itself.
This one specifically showcases how hiveminds can be used in RLBot for coordinated manuevers, such as team pinches (A mechanic where the ball is squeezed between two cars to launch it at high speeds.)

Read `README.ipynb` to find out more about how it works and how to set up your own.
