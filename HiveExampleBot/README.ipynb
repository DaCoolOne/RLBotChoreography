    "The hivemind is just a single process controlling multiple bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure is composed of a bot file that creates a `helper process request` and a main hivemind file.\n",
    "The bot file initiates a seperate process which then receives all of the bot indicies which requested it with the same key, which the process can then use to send control inputs to the bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the bot file `hive_example.py`. This is the file you point your config towards. (i.e. `python_file = ./hive_example.py`)\n",
    "This will be very similar in every hivemind bot, except for the **keys**. It is important that your **keys are unique**, because otherwise the first bot with those keys will initiate a hivemind that will then also control your bots (with the same key). It is also important to have **different keys for the Blue and Orange teams**, otherwise only a single hivemind process will be initiated for both teams."

    "\n",

More notably, a **GameInterface** is created which you will use to access things such as the GameTickPacket, BallPrediction, or FieldInfo. `self.running_indices` is also initialised, which will contain the indices of the bots that request this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `start()`, The process fetches the agent indices. If you are trying to run a lot of bots and running into problems where they cannot connect to the hivemind, try increasing the amount of time that you sleep for before running `try_receive_agent_metadata()`.\n",
    "You can put initialisation code here if you want. Stuff such as creating objects which will house the data (Shown later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to `game_loop()`. This is where your hivemind will spend the rest of it's time. It contains an infinite loop that will run at most 120 times per second (courtesy of the rate_limiter.) You can think of this loop running every game tick, similar to how normal python bots get their `get_output()` called every tick.\n",
    "\n",
    "To send the control input to each bot under the hivemind's control, you create a `PlayerInput` object which is very similar to the more familiar `SimpleControllerState`. You then use `self.game_interface.update_player_input()` to send the controls to the given index.\n",
