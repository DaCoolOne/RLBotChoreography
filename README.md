# RLBot
Custom Bots for Rocket League.

My RLBot story so far:

  - I started working on RLBot in January of 2019.
  - I created BoostHog, a bot which just tries to collect boost. That was my introduction, my 'Hello World', to the RLBot Framework. 
  - In the community discord I heard of an upcoming tournament, Wintertide, and decided to quickly put together a bot to try and qualify. I managed to just make the cut, only to lose in the first match. 
  - After the tournament, I tried to remake Calculator, now without having to rush to meet a deadline. Unfortunately, this period did not last long, because I had to take a break from programming to focus on my A Levels. 
  - I returned to RLBot in July of 2019 with a renewed sense of purpose. I decided to start a new bot, based on an idea in the back of my head since starting Calculator. I wanted to make a hivemind. That is exactly what my latest bot is. It is an attempt at controlling multiple agents intelligently using only one process. 
  - I also participated in a Speedbots tournament in late July of 2019 in which I needed to make a bot in 3 hours. I used the hivemind framework and I made some good progress, but due to bad task prioritisation the bot ended up just being an ATBA and it lost all its matches.
  - I hope that HiveBot will break the common theme and shake up the 3v3 bot meta.
